# commit_analysis

Before the execution of the script, please clone the openstack nova project(https://github.com/openstack/nova) to the local folder with the relative path "/tmp/nova". Also, please install the GitPython library using the command "pip install GitPython".

Below are the script execution instructions:

1) After the cloning of the nova repository to the local folder, we just have to run the script with the command 'python main.py' in the terminal. 
2) The output based on both the measures, i.e; the number of commits and the churn is displayed in the terminal.
